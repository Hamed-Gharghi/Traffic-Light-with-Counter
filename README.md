# Traffic-Light-with-Counter
This repository contains C code(Code vision file)  and Proteus simulation files for a traffic light control system. The system includes three lights (red, yellow, and green) and a two-digit counter to display the remaining time for each light. The duration of each light can be adjusted in real-time using buttons.
